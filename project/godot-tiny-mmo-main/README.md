# Godot Tiny MMO

A tiny web-based MMO / MMORPG demo developed with Godot Engine 4.x - 4.3,  
created without relying on the built-in multiplayer nodes.  

This project contains both client and server within the same codebase.  
Using custom export presets, you can easily [**Export Client and Server builds separately**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki/Exporting-the-project).  
This keeps exports safe and optimized by excluding unnecessary components.    

For additional details, check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/SlayHorizon/godot-tiny-mmo-demo/wiki).
